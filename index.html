<article>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Joshua Bowen and writing this site with me is my girlfriend Kimberly Castro. This website is for anyone who wishes to learn how to connect with their communities via their iPhones, iPads, Macs, etc. It is written by two completely blind individuals who not only use these devices on a daily basis, but are offering our collective knowledge to fellow blind and low vision individuals whom may have just purchased or received their first Apple device ... but need step by step instructions to connect with others around them. It's no fun to live in a kingdom of isolation, right? I've had my iPhone since 2012 and Josh has had his since 2009. Josh teaches people how to use these Apple devices and I basically taught myself through several Google searches.
</p>
<h2>What this site will cover</h2>
<p>This website will help you navigate the world around you with the assistance of an app called BlindSquare or reconnect with a friend you haven't contacted in a long while using FaceTime. Have fun learning how to use the Apple devices my boyfriend and I can't live without!

<h3>Why IOS</h3>
<p>
While there has been strides in the Android operating systems in terms of accessibility over the years, the IOS operating system has built-in accessibility features that are very robust. These features cover a wide range of disabilities such as hearing, vision impairment both speech output and magnification as well as support for people who have intellectual or physical challenges. Also, the support for a person just getting started out of the box is consistent across IPhone models which is not the case for the Android Operating System. This is why the two authors have chosen to focus on the Apple platform both for consistency in functions across devices as well as Apple's well known and documented support for disabilities.
