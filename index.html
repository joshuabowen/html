<article>
<p>Hello everyone allow me to introduce myself. My name is Joshua Bowen.
<br>
I began coding in html not that long ago. I am still in the beginning stages of learning the fundamentals of this robust markup language. This site is going to consist of a collection of my projects from my course. I want to use this site as a platform to show what I can do and to show what I have learned.
</p>
<h2>Why I began coding</h2>
<p>The main reason why I began coding was I found that I like it. I like creating something with my own two hands and putting it out there for the world to see.
<br>
As a totally blind person, coding is something that I don't half to see to do. It is something that I can create on a computer without needing to actually see the images or videos. If the code is right then the site will behave the way I want it to.
</p>
<h3>Wear this site is going</h3>
<p>As I continue on this coding journey, I am going to learn elements from not only html but Java as well and other programming languages. As I master these elements, the navigation menu at the top of the page will increase as I complete more tasks and projects.
<br>
I would love any feedback or comments on this site or it's content. I would also like any coding ideas you might have based on this sites content. My contact information can be found on my contact page which is located in the sites top navigation menu at the top of the page. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
